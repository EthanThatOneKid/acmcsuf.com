      There I was again tonight<br />
      Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br />
      Same old tired lonely place<br />
      <br />
      Walls of insincerity,<br />
      Shifting eyes and vacancy<br />
      Vanished when I saw your face<br />
      <br />
      All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br />
      <br />
      Your eyes whispered, &quot;Have we met?&quot;<br />
      Across the room your silhouette<br />
      Starts to make its way to me<br />
      The playful conversation starts<br />
      Counter all your quick remarks<br />
      Like passing notes in secrecy<br />
      <br />
      And it was enchanting to meet you<br />
      All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you<br />
      <br />
      This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br />
      I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br />
      I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
      I was enchanted to meet you<br />
      <br />
      The lingering question kept me up<br />
      2 AM, who do you love?<br />
      I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br />
      And now I'm pacing back and forth<br />
      Wishing you were at my door<br />
      I'd open up and you would say, &quot;Hey,<br />
      It was enchanting to meet you,<br />
      All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br />
      I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br />
      I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
      This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br />
      I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br />
      I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
      I was enchanted to meet you<br />
      <br />
      This is me praying that<br />
      This was the very first page<br />
      Not where the story line ends<br />
      My thoughts will echo your name<br />
      Until I see you again<br />
      These are the words I held back<br />
      As I was leaving too soon<br />
      I was enchanted to meet you<br />
      <br />
      Please don't be in love with someone else<br />
      Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br />
      Please don't be in love with someone else<br />
      Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br />
      <br />
      This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br />
      I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br />
      I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
      This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br />
      (Please don't be in love with someone else)<br />
      I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br />
      (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)<br />
      I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
      (Please don't be in love with someone else)<br />
      I was enchanted to meet you<br />
      <br />
      Please don't be in love with someone else<br />
      Please don't have somebody waiting on you
