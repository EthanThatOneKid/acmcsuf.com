    <h2 class="headers">Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This privacy policy is an agreement between you, the user of our services (the “User”), and
      the Association for Computing Machinery chapter at California State University, Fullerton
      (henceforth “ACM”). By registering for access to all channels in the ACM Discord server (the
      “Discord”), you hereby agree to all the terms of this agreement. The terms and conditions
      described in this policy shall apply exclusively to usage and management of Discord bots made
      by ACM (the “services”), and shall not apply to the general distribution of data from Discord
      by other users or by members of ACM. The distribution of data through other means is regulated
      by the Discord Terms of Service <a href="https://discord.com/terms"
        >(https://discord.com/terms)</a
      >
      and the Discord Privacy Policy
      <a href="https://discord.com/privacy"> (https://discord.com/privacy)</a>. The valid, working
      version of this privacy policy shall exclusively be hosted on the ACM website (the “Website”)
      at <a href="https://acmcsuf.com/privacy"> https://acmcsuf.com/privacy</a>. This information
      details the data which we collect about you, basic rights as recognized under the laws
      covering the jurisdiction where ACM resides, and how to exercise your rights.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="information-we-collect">
    <h2 class="headers">Information we collect</h2>

    <p>
      We may collect any information that is submitted over Discord, including but not limited to
      messages sent in the ACM discord, forms submitted through ACM discord bots, Discord profile
      information, and other communications made over Discord. This data may be associated with your
      identity through any identifying information you provide over any channels. Any personal
      information provided to another person may enter our data collections in the event that they
      distribute the data over Discord or through some other means of interaction with our Discord
      bots; this data shall be considered their data, but we may, at our discretion, honor requests
      by a user to delete their personal information when submitted by another individual.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="authority">
    <h2 class="headers">Authority</h2>

    <p>
      The right to handle requests under this agreement shall generally, as well as when explicitly
      stated, be given to General Board members of ACM, as defined by ACM’s Constitution (in its
      latest revision). However, at any time when General Board members have jurisdiction over an
      action, they may choose (either recurring or for a specific instance) to designate authority
      over a request to another member of ACM, who shall have the full authority to handle the
      request(s) and action(s) as per the provisions of this policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="data-sale-and-distribution">
    <h2 class="headers">Data sale and distribution</h2>

    <p>
      ACM shall not, under any circumstances, sell your data in any way through bots created by ACM
      in the Discord. This does not limit any other rights of distribution of messages directly
      through Discord; ACM simply agrees not to sell data directly from collections made by our
      Discord bots. We may aggregate and entirely anonymize data, and use that data for ACM
      promotional purposes; we will take all reasonable measures to ensure that no data from among
      our collected data with personally identifiable information is distributed. Under certain
      circumstances, we may need to distribute lists of event attendees as collected by the services
      to California State University, Fullerton; by registering for an event, you agree to this
      distribution. We also reserve the right to distribute Discord messages using Discord bots for
      ACM projects and in support of projects by students and alumni of California State University,
      Fullerton. Further, the ACM Discord is considered a public forum, and all messages in it are
      (to the extent allowed by law) public domain; as such, individuals may use data for purposes
      outside the scope of this policy, and ACM may use the data for purposes determinable in its
      sole discretion.
    </p>

  <section id="accessing-your-data">
    <h2 class="headers">Accessing your data</h2>

    <p>
      You have a right to know what data we have collected about you. In addition to the categories
      listed in this document, you may directly access your data by submitting a request to a
      General Board member of ACM. We will comply with this request within 45 days, or within limits
      specified by local law, whichever is shorter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="disclosure-to-law-enforcement">
    <h2 class="headers">Disclosure to law enforcement</h2>

    <p>
      Except where bound by valid court order or by other enforceable, legal order from within the
      United States, or as where bound by California laws requiring disclosure, we will not disclose
      any information under any circumstances to any law enforcement agency, including limited
      jurisdiction enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We
      will not enforce the disclosure laws of any other jurisdiction without an order certified by a
      court residing within California, whether state or federal, demanding the disclosure of the
      documents, and we reserve the right to confer with legal or other counsel prior to disclosing
      any data we have collected.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="right-of-correction">
    <h2 class="headers">Right of correction</h2>

    <p>
      You have the right to correct any information which you deem to be incorrect stored on our
      servers or other databases owned by ACM. You must submit a request listing what information is
      incorrect, and what it should be changed to, to a General Board member of ACM. We will comply
      with the request within 45 days, or within limits specified by local law, whichever is
      shorter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="data-retention">
    <h2 class="headers">Data retention</h2>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to retain any data collected indefinitely, unless it must be deleted by
      applicable laws, you request to delete it, or we lose the data. If the services are
      discontinued by ACM, users will be given a 14-day notice during which they may request copies
      of their data, after which point the data will be deleted.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="amendments">
    <h2 class="headers">Amendments</h2>

    <p>
      We may, at our sole discretion, amend the terms of this privacy policy. Changes which do not
      affect the actual effects of the policy may be made at any time, without any advance notice.
      Changes which affect manners of substance shall be given 14 days notice, both on the Website
      and on the Discord. By continuing to use the services after the termination of the notice, you
      agree to any changes made to this policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="in-state-info-access">
    <h2 class="headers">Information for users accessing from California and other U.S. states</h2>

    <p>
      Laws in California and other U.S. states may give you extra rights and protections than laws
      in other states. As we are registered and organized in California, we will extend the rights
      of those accessing our services from California to all users of our services. While we are not
      bound by all of the conditions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (and successor
      legislation), we will generally (with the ability to, at our discretion, reduce our actions to
      only those required by law) comply with it as if we were bound by it. If you would like to
      exert your rights as provided by the laws of another state, you must contact us with a request
      to exert those rights, as well as citations to the applicable laws for your jurisdiction.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="out-of-state-info-access">
    <h2 class="headers">
      Information for users accessing from the European Union, European Economic Area, United
      Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil
    </h2>

    <p>
      We will fully respect all rights under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR), Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), and any other applicable local laws
      regarding data privacy. We are not incorporated, registered, or organized in any of these
      territories, and thus laws applying to local organizations do not apply to us; however, you
      still reserve your rights as would be applied to foreign organizations, including but not
      limited to the right to access, rectify, erase, limit the processing, disseminate, object, and
      withdraw consent over the usage of your data. We do not hold registration with any data
      protection agencies, or have a designated data protection officer. We may, at our discretion,
      allow users from outside these territories to exercise the same rights as users from these
      territories.
