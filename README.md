## Develop [👩‍💻][figma_design]

> 💡 This project runs on NodeJS; [install the latest long-term support version][node_download].

To get started, clone this repository to your machine and run `npm i` in the root of this project.
Then, run `npm run dev` to spin up the [development server][dev_server].

## Deployment 🚀

Whenever a push is made to the main branch, Vercel builds the site, tests it, and if there are no errors, it will deploy a preview site.
Once an admin approves the preview site, it gets promoted to production.
