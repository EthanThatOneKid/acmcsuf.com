## Deployment üöÄ

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ee624373-9c84-4f33-a5db-daa69d18ae6e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/acmcsuf/deploys)

Whenever a push is made to the main branch, Netlify builds the site, tests it, and if there are no errors, it will deploy a preview site.
Once all checks have been passed, the preview site gets promoted to production.
